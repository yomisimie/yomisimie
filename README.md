### Hi there 👋
Web developer in learning.
Started with Wordpress and Opencart.
Moved on to Symfony and Angular.
Now upgraded to JS with Node and React with some C# in between.
Used Bootstrap for a few years, now learning Tailwind.


Current projects:
🙋 QOTD - a discord bot to ask a Question of the Day for a friend's server
🕹️ GTV - a discord bot to use to question other people about a video game that you know of with description, images and hints
📻 Grand Theft Radio - Angular ongoing project to recreate GTA V radio in browser. Most of the work done, needs some fine tweaking


Fun fact 🤔:
The sweet orange is not a wild fruit, it is a cross between a pomelo and a mandarin.
